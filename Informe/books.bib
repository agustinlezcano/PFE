title = {Design and Kinematics Analysis of a Percutaneous Needle Insertion Robotic System},
journal = {IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering},
abstract = {To overcome the limitations of conventional manual percutaneous needle insertion procedure, this paper proposes a percutaneous needle insertion robotic system with functions of biopsy and ablation. First, the robotic system, which integrates a 4-DOF positioning robotic arm and a 2-DOF RCM wrist, is designed. The 4-DOF positioning robotic arm can realize the exact position of the puncture needle and the 2-DOF RCM wrist can accurately adjust the orientation the needle. The combination of these two modules can ensure the kinematic decoupling of the position and posture of the robotic system. Second, the kinematics model of the robotic system based on classical D-H method is established, and the forward kinematics and inverse kinematics of the robotic system are analyzed. Finally, the manufacturing and assembly of the overall robotic system is performed and the robotic arm can successfully achieve percutaneous biopsy and ablation for tumor in urinary system.}
